Building a Secure Smartphone Society
------------------------------------

This guidebook is a collection of tips concerning the know-how of
secure designs and secure coding for Android application developers.
Our intent is to have as many Android application developers as
possible take advantage of this, and for that reason we are making it
public.

In recent years, the smartphone market has witnessed a rapid
expansion, and its momentum seems unstoppable. Its accelerated growth
is brought on due to the diverse range of applications. An unspecified
large number of key functions of mobile phones that were once not
accessible due to security restrictions on conventional mobile phones
have been made open to smartphone applications. Subsequently, the
availability of varied applications that were once closed to
conventional mobile phones is what makes smartphones more attractive.

With great power that comes from smartphone applications comes great
responsibility from their developers. The default security
restrictions on conventional mobile phones had made it possible to
maintain a relative level of security even for applications that were
developed without security awareness. As it has been aforementioned
with regard to smartphones, since the key advantage of a smartphone is
that they are open to application developers, if the developers design
or code their applications without the knowledge of security issues
then this could lead to risks of users\' personal information leakage
or exploitation by malware causing financial damage such as from
illicit calls to premium-rate numbers.

Due to Android being a very open model allowing access to many
functions on the smartphone, it is believed that Android application
developers need to take more care about security issues than iOS
application developers. In addition, responsibility for application
security is almost solely left to the application developers. For
example, applications can be released to the public without any
screening from a marketplace such as Google Play (former Android
Market), though this is not possible for iOS applications.

In conjunction with the rapid growth of the smartphone market, there
has been a sudden influx of software engineers from different areas in
the smartphone application development market. As a result, there is
an urgent call for the sharing knowledge of secure design and
consolidation of secure coding know-how for specific security issues
related to mobile applications.

Due to these circumstances, Japan\'s Smartphone Security Association
(JSSEC) has launched the Secure Coding Group, and by collecting the
know-how of secure design as well as secure coding of Android
applications, it has decided to make all of the information public
with this guidebook. It is our intention to raise the security level
of many of the Android applications that are released in the market by
having many Android application developers become acquainted with the
know-how of secure design and coding. As a result, we believe we will
be contributing to the creation of a more reliable and safe smartphone
society.

Timely Feedback on a Regular Basis Through the Beta Version
-----------------------------------------------------------

We, the JSSEC Secure Coding Group, will do our best to keep the
content contained in the Guidebook as accurate as possible, but we
cannot make any guarantees. We believe it is our priority to publicize
and share the know-how in a timely fashion. Equally, we will upload
and publicize what we consider to be the latest and most accurate
correct information at that particular juncture, and will update it
with more accurate information once we receive any feedback or
corrections. In other words, we are taking the beta version approach
on a regular basis. We think this approach would be meaningful for
many of the Android application developers who are planning on using
the Guidebook.
